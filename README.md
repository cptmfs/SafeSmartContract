# SafeSmartContract
 
In this final project, I created a Secure Smart Contract on the BNB Chain, which acts as a secure vault for users to lock their tokens for a set period of time and earn rewards over time. 
Each user has a separate compartment within the contract, allowing for individualized security and reward calculation.
# Features
* Token Locking: Users can send tokens to the contract and lock them for a certain period of time.
* Reward Calculation: The contract will calculate rewards based on the time the tokens are locked.
* Individual Pods: Each user will have a unique compartment within the contract, providing personalized security and reward management.
# Requirements
* Token Locking Mechanism: A function that allows users to send tokens to the contract and lock them for a certain period of time.
* Reward Calculation: A mechanism for calculating rewards based on the locking period. The contract only calculates rewards.
* User Pods: Separate panes are created for each user in the contract to manage their tokens and rewards separately.
* Security Measures: Security controls necessary to ensure that only the holder of the tokens can lock, unlock or query their compartment.
